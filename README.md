# Secure Hybrid Access to S3 using VPC Endpoints

A comprehensive AWS workshop demonstrating how to securely access Amazon S3 from both cloud and on-premises environments using VPC endpoints and AWS PrivateLink.

## 🎯 Workshop Overview

This hands-on workshop teaches you how to implement secure, private connectivity to Amazon S3 without exposing traffic to the public internet. You'll learn to configure and test two types of VPC endpoints:

- **Gateway VPC Endpoint** - For accessing S3 from cloud resources using private IP addresses
- **Interface VPC Endpoint** - For accessing S3 from on-premises locations via AWS PrivateLink

## 🏗️ Architecture

The workshop uses a dual-VPC architecture:

- **VPC Cloud** - Simulates cloud resources with Gateway endpoints and EC2 instances
- **VPC On-Premises** - Simulates on-premises environment with Site-to-Site VPN connectivity via AWS Transit Gateway

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By completing this workshop, you will:

- Understand AWS PrivateLink and VPC endpoint concepts
- Configure Gateway VPC endpoints for S3 access from cloud resources
- Set up Interface VPC endpoints for hybrid connectivity
- Implement VPC endpoint policies for enhanced security
- Test connectivity from both cloud and simulated on-premises environments
- Apply networking best practices for secure AWS service access

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of AWS VPC, EC2, and S3 services

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This workshop creates AWS resources that may incur costs
- Always follow the cleanup instructions to avoid unexpected charges
- The simulated on-premises environment uses a single VPN instance for cost optimization
- For production workloads, implement multiple VPN devices for high availability
